# Regression Analysis with Python

This repository demonstrates a basic implementation of linear regression for predicting house prices in California using the California Housing dataset from scikit-learn.

## Project Overview

This project explores the following aspects of regression analysis:

Data loading and preprocessing (using pandas)
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with seaborn
Model training and prediction using a LinearRegression model from scikit-learn
Evaluation metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²)
Model generalizability assessment through k-fold cross-validation
## Getting Started

Prerequisites:

Python 3.x with essential libraries:
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn (specifically linear_model, model_selection, metrics, datasets)
matplotlib.pyplot (as plt)
seaborn (as sns)
Installation:

If you don't have these libraries installed, you can use the following command in your terminal:

Bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Use code with caution.

Execution:

Clone this repository.
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
Run the script:
Bash
python regression_analysis.py
Use code with caution.

This will execute the code, perform the analysis, and display the results.

## Code Structure

The script regression_analysis.py comprises the core functionalities:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:
Loads the California Housing dataset using fetch_california_housing from scikit-learn.
Converts it into a pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation.
Exploratory Data Analysis:
Displays the first few rows of the data using df.head().
Generates summary statistics with df.describe().
Creates a heatmap to visualize correlations between features using seaborn.heatmap.
Model Training and Prediction:
Splits the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
Selects features (X) and target variable (y).
Trains a Linear Regression model from scikit-learn with model.fit(X_train, y_train).
Makes predictions on the testing set using model.predict(X_test).
Evaluation Metrics:
Calculates Mean Squared Error (MSE) with mean_squared_error.
Computes R-squared (R²) with r2_score.
Prints the evaluation metrics.
Cross-Validation:
Performs k-fold cross-validation with cross_val_score to assess model generalizability.
Prints the cross-validation R² scores and their mean.
Visualization:
Creates a scatter plot of actual vs. predicted values using matplotlib.pyplot.
## Further Exploration

This project provides a basic framework. You can extend it by exploring:

Different regression models (e.g., Ridge, Lasso) for comparison.
Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
Feature engineering techniques to improve model accuracy.
More comprehensive model evaluation metrics (e.g., Mean Absolute Error, R-adjusted).
